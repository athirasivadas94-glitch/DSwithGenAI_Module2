# ABC Employee Data Analysis
Dataset from ABC company,consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Project tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically.

 1. Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset underwent the following preprocessing steps:

1. **Height Correction**  
   - The "Height" column contained inconsistent values.  
   - Replaced all values with random integers between **150–180 cm** to maintain data integrity.

2. **Data Validation**  
   - Checked for missing values.
  
  2. Analysis and Graphical Representation
